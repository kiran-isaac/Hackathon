Task one: Directory Reconstruction:

Add the file with the input data to the directory in the form of a `.txt` file. The file should have a name `input.txt` or you can use the name that you have for this file but make sure to change `ifstream inputFile("input.txt");` in the main() in this case.
Run the program in the usual way: ./{file_name}. File name is currently `directory_reconstruction.cpp`.
